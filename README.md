In this Project I have implemented the Digit Recognition by using the deep learning methods and machine learning algorithm. This will process the images taken from the MNIST dataset using single layer convolutional neural network and Two layered convolutional neural network after which the images where flipped and performed the process. This paper also implemented the recognition using Support Vector Machine(SVM) and compared the accuracy of finding the digit in the above stated methods. I have used Tensor flow and keras for CNN.

#### These are the Results of finding by different methods :

Accuracy of Finding the digit using Simple Convolutional Layer                : 99.07 %

Accuracy of Finding the digit using Large Convolutional Layer                   : 99.26 %

Accuracy of Finding the digit using Large Convolutional Layer                   : 96.46 %
with image flip of degree 180 

Accuracy of Finding the digit using Support Vector Machine (SVM)            : 98.52 %
